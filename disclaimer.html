                    The law applies to all procurement and contracting activities and procedures of federal entities, including ministries, authorities, central agencies, as well as subsidiaries under them.
                    
                    The law also specifies the entities that are exempt from following this law due to the nature of their activities and the special regulations that exist to govern their procurements.
                    
                    The law, which entered into force on December 1, 2023, does not apply to federal entities, procurement contracts concluded before the aforementioned date. However, the provisions of Federal Decree-Law No. 11 of 2023 must be followed upon amendment, renewal, or extension of these existing contracts.</p>
